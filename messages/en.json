      "p1": "Photo To URL is built for creators, marketers, support teams, founders, and anyone who needs a quick, reliable way to turn photos into clean links. With a direct upload-to-link flow, you avoid heavy media managers and skip logins. Links are tidy, easy to paste into chat apps, docs, wikis, bug reports, and tickets. Teams move faster when screenshots and product photos are instantly shareable without attachment limits or messy previews. Because the links are predictable and consistent, they also work well in automation, QA steps, and lightweight prototypes.",
      "p2": "The experience stays simple: drop, paste, or browse; get a link; share. No extra chrome, no distracting ads, no gating. You keep focus on your content while we handle the boring parts of hosting. Whether you are documenting a feature, preparing a blog post, building a pitch deck, or sending a quick support response, a short link beats bulky attachments. For global teams, the interface is available in multiple languages while keeping copy concise and universal.",

          "2": "Support and QA: attach reproducible screenshots in tickets, chat threads, or runbooks; links stay tidy and easy to track.",
          "3": "Docs and blogs: embed photos in Markdown, HTML, or CMS editors with predictable URLs and no layout surprises.",
          "4": "Sales and CS: drop proof-of-concept captures or customer walkthroughs straight into email or messaging.",
          "5": "Engineering handoff: keep build artifacts, error snaps, and regression visuals lightweight for faster reviews.",

        "p1": "1) Choose an image: drag-and-drop, paste from clipboard, or click to browse. PNG, JPG, WEBP, GIF up to 10MB are supported now. 2) We upload and return a direct link. The UI shows your URL immediately with copy, open, and multi-format save actions (.txt, .json, .md). 3) You reuse the link anywhere: blogs, docs, tickets, chat, prototypes. The goal is a frictionless bridge between your photo and the places you work.",
        "p2": "Each step is tuned for clarity: visible status, friendly errors, and buttons that confirm actions. The copy button sits next to the link, and the save buttons let you keep the URL in your preferred format for bookmarking or automation. When R2 is enabled, links serve from the CDN domain; if the service is in maintenance, the UI returns a clear message instead of raw errors."
